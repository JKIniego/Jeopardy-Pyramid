Learning by analogy allows AI systems to apply knowledge from familiar situations to unfamiliar ones by making complex transformations between known and unknown concepts, which makes it more inference-driven.#How does learning by analogy function to apply the unknown to known knowledge?#How does learning by analogy reject the use of inference?#Why is learning by analogy only about memorizing facts?#What is the reason learning by analogy avoids applying examples to new problems?
Failure-driven in AI emphasizes improvement through errors by creating solutions that prevent repeated mistakes, resembling human learning processes where experiences of failure guide future problem-solving strategies.#How does failure-driven learning highlight the importance of analyzing errors to avoid repeating mistakes?#How does failure-driven learning ensure mistakes are ignored instead of corrected?#Why is failure-driven learning a method that avoids trial and error?#What is the role of failure-driven learning in guaranteeing perfect performance from the start?
Since some problems cannot be solved by fixed algorithms, machine learning instead uses large collections of past examples to detect patterns and build models that can adapt overtime.#How does machine learning address problems without fixed algorithms?#Why are problems liek spam detection fully solvable with one static algorithm?#Why does machine learning guarantee perfect accuracy in predicting future outcomes?#How does machine learning replace the need for any data collection when solving new problems?
Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that groups inputs with similar attributes, allowing applications like customer segmentation, image compression, and bioinformatics motif discovery.#What makes clustering useful for uncovering hidden structures in data without needing labled outputs?#Why is clustering ineffective when applied to numerical data like prices or mileage?#How does clustering always guarantee perfectly balanced groups across all datasets?#Why is clustering only applicable to text data rather than images?
Base learners in an ensemble can either be homogeneous, produced by the same algorithm, or heterogeneous, generated by different algorithms, depending on the method used.#How does the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous base learners affect ensemble construction?#Why do ensembles ignore the differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous learners?#What makes heterogeneous ensembles automatically better than homogeneous ones?#Why ensembles must only use one algorithm?
Ensemble methods are effective because they can combine the outputs of weak learners, each only slightly better than random guessing, in a way that the aggregated decision achieves strong predictive accuracy.#How does combining the outputs of weak learners lead to stronger overall predictions?#Why do ensemble methods fail to combine the outputs of weak learners?#Why are weak learners naturally more accurate than strong learners?#What prevents weak learners from being useful in ensemble models?
When training data are limited, different hypotheses may perform equally well on the data, and ensemble methods reduce the danger of selecting a single one that fails on future data.#Why does combining multiple hypotheses provide a safeguard against future prediction errors?#Which hypothesis always guarantees perfect accuracy?#How many hypotheses are needed to make an ensemble useful?#What is the definition of the hypothesis space?
Stacking improves prediction by training a second-level learner (meta-learner) on the outputs of first-level learners, but to avoid overfitting, the data used for the second-level model must be generated carefully with cross-validation.#How does stacking improve its prediction?#What is the formula for the cross-validation error in stacking?#How many folds should always be used in stacking cross-validation?#Which single algorithm is best suited as a meta-learner?
