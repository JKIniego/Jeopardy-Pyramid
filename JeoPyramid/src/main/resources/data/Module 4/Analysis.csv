Sussman’s Hacker corrects its program whenever a bug halts execution ensuring that the particular bug will not occur again for the succeeding use of the program.#What are the features of Sussman’s Hacker that aid in correcting the bug that halts execution?#How is Sussman’s Hacker similar to failure-driven learning?#How does failure-driven learning compare or contrast with direct instruction in terms of learning from mistakes?#What evidence can you list for the “gallery” of “critics” that performs the plan criticism to a program?
Although machine learning methods should be general-purpose, fully automatic, and “off-the-shelf,” it must incorporate prior, human knowledge as it is crucial in practice.#How does the general-purpose characteristic compare or contrast with prior, human knowledge in machine learning?#What are the parts or features of machine learning that play a role between theory and practice?#If prior, human knowledge were to be replaced with new knowledge, how might it affect machine learning in practice?#What evidence can you use to support the idea of machine learning in practice?
Classification is a supervised learning problem involving classification of a dataset whereas regression is a supervised learning problem involving continuous numeric value.#How does classification contrast with regression in terms of output?#How is classification similar to regression?#What are the parts or features of classification and regression that make them a supervised learning problem?#How can you categorize classification and regression based on their outputs alone?
In supervised learning, an input is mapped to produce an output with a supervisor, while in unsupervised learning, there is no supervisor and it only finds regularities in the input.#How does supervised learning compare to unsupervised learning in terms of input?#What are the features of supervised learning which lack from unsupervised learning?#What would happen if unsupervised learning has an output similar to supervised learning?#How is supervised learning similar to unsupervised learning?
A model learned by using machine learning may be predictive to make predictions in the future or descriptive to acquire knowledge.#What are the features of a model that optimizes a performance criterion using sample data or past experience?#What distinction can be drawn on prediction and descriptive in terms of output?#What are the key features used when processing raw knowledge in order to predict the future?#How is being predictive related to being descriptive?
Pattern recognition community focused on combining classifiers, machine learning community focused on ensembles of weak learners, and neural networks community focused on mixture of experts.#How do these early threads of contributions compare based on the community that studied them?#What evidence can you provide that these early threads of contributions were studied in a single community?#How does each of the communities compare/contrast in terms of ensemble methods?#How might the history of ensemble methods be changed if it were to be studied by other communities?
Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a supervised approach focusing on
distinguishing between different classes, while principal component analysis (PCA) is an unsupervised
approach generally used to identify the largest variability.#How does LDA compare and contrast with PCA?#How does LDA and PCA differ in terms of linear regression representation?#What evidence can you list for why LDA is better than PCA?#What are the parts and features of LDA and PCA?
Weighted averaging is not superior to simple averaging in practice because data in real tasks are noisy and insufficient leading to unreliable estimated weights.#What evidence can you list that explains why weighted averaging is not always superior to simple averaging?#How is simple averaging different from weighted averaging?#What are the features of weighted averaging that accounts for weights?#What would have happened if we modify simple averaging in such a way that weights are integrated?
Majority voting requires the winner to take at least half of the votes while plurality voting requires the winner to take the class label which receives the most number of votes.#What are the features of majority and plurality voting that distinguishes them from producing the winner?#How does majority voting compare or contrast with plurality voting in terms of presence of a reject option?#What evidence can you list off that explains why majority voting is better than plurality voting?#How is majority voting similar with plurality voting in terms of producing an output?
