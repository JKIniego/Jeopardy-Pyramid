To solve nonlinear problems like XOR, use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with at least two layers, since a single-layer perceptron can’t handle nonlinearity. Add a nonlinear activation function like ReLU between layers to keep the network from acting linearly. In Keras, this can be done with two Dense layers using ReLU.#How would you design a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) architecture to successfully "learn" the XOR function, given the function's property of being non-linearly separable?#How would you select activation functions and unit counts in an MLP so it can approximate arbitrary Boolean functions beyond XOR?#How would you design a training regimen (initialization, learning rate, regularization) to ensure an MLP reliably converges on small-scale logic tasks like XOR?#How would you construct a minimal neural architecture that demonstrates the representational difference between linear and nonlinear decision boundaries?
To improve stability and performance, use Batch Normalization to keep layer outputs centered and scaled. To reduce overfitting, apply Dropout, which randomly turns off some hidden units during training to make the network more robust.#How would you create a combined strategy for training a complex neural network that simultaneously focuses on increasing training stability and preventing the common challenge of overfitting?#How would you design an adaptive regularization schedule that changes dropout, weight decay, or data augmentation during training to balance stability and generalization?#How would you integrate ensemble methods and early-stopping policies into a unified training pipeline to reduce variance while maintaining stable convergence?#How would you formulate a curriculum learning plan that slowly increases task difficulty to stabilize gradients and reduce the risk of overfitting?
ReLU is preferred because it gives a more stable gradient and helps prevent the vanishing gradient problem. Unlike the Sigmoid function, which flattens at high or low inputs and causes tiny gradients, ReLU passes positive values directly (ReLU(x) = x if x ≥ 0), keeping gradients from reaching zero during backpropagation.#What would you infer about the stability of gradient updates during backpropagation when using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function compared to the Sigmoid function, and why?#What would you infer about gradient saturation effects when using Tanh versus Sigmoid activations and how that impacts training dynamics?#What would you infer about gradient flow and dead-unit risks when using Leaky ReLU or ELU instead of standard ReLU?#What would you infer about training stability when combining batch normalization with Sigmoid activations versus using ReLU without normalization?
For tasks like image captioning that involve sequential or multimodal data, combine CNNs (to extract image features) with RNNs/LSTMs (to generate word sequences). CNNs handle visual input, while RNNs or LSTMs manage language and sequence modeling.#What might happen if you combined Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs with CNNs for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, such as image captioning?#What might happen if you replaced the RNN/LSTM decoder with a Transformer decoder when paired with a CNN encoder for image captioning?#What might happen if you used CNNs to extract spatial features and then applied temporal attention mechanisms instead of LSTMs for caption generation?#What might happen if you trained a joint CNN–RNN model end-to-end on multimodal datasets with different domain shifts (e.g., photos vs. paintings)?

Training a model needs key hyperparameters in three stages. First, set the number of hidden layers, neurons, and how weights are initialized. Next, choose an activation function for forward propagation. Finally, pick a cost function, optimizer, and learning rate for backpropagation.
