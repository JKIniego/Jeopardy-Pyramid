Examine long-term behaviour: Do they bury the robot, seek emotional support after “killing” it, and maintain beliefs consistent with truly believing in robot pain?#How would you use the concept of "seriousness" to evaluate whether someone genuinely believes their robot pet experiences pain when struck?#What way would you plan to distinguish between metaphorical and literal claims about robot suffering in an experimental setting?#How would you solve the problem of distinguishing genuine from performative empathy toward robots in human-robot interaction studies?#How would you apply behavioral observation methods to determine if elderly users truly believe their AI companions have feelings?
The AI would be safer and more beneficial, intelligible, robust, unhackable, and failing gracefully, addressing safety concerns without requiring full moral personhood.#What would result if researchers developed "Friendly AI" with algorithms that are transparent, predictable, and proven reliable by mathematics rather than empirical testing?#What would result if financial trading algorithms were designed with transparency and predictability as primary goals?#How would you solve the problem of AI unpredictability by developing systems with logically verifiable decision-making processes?#How would you apply mathematical proof methods to ensure an autonomous system's reliability before deployment in critical infrastructure?
The moral status of machines is tested by applying the concept of “persons” to a catastrophic power loss scenario where a choice must be made between which patient should be provided with continuing life support.#How would you demonstrate achieving the moral standing of a person using Artificial Intelligence?#How is moral standing related to the Turing Triage Test?#Why is Artificial Intelligence significant in decision making scenarios?#What factors would you change if “persons” were applied instead of “human beings”?
Collect temperature-congestion data, divide into training/validation sets, plot regression lines from training data, validate it, then use it for future predictions.#How would you use linear regression to predict and manage traffic congestion in a smart city as weather conditions change?#What way would you plan to use historical weather and traffic data to forecast rush-hour delays in an urban transportation system?#How would you solve the problem of predicting public transit demand using temperature as an independent variable?#How would you apply supervised learning techniques to develop a model for estimating parking availability based on seasonal patterns?
Group VM requests with similar resource needs into clusters, assign efficiently to physical machines, then put unused servers to sleep, reducing energy consumption.#How would you apply K-means clustering to optimize energy usage in a government data center serving multiple agencies?#What way would you plan to reduce power consumption in a smart city's computing infrastructure using unsupervised learning techniques?#How would you apply what you learned about grouping similar workloads to develop an energy-efficient cloud computing strategy?#How would you solve the problem of resource allocation across diverse government services using clustering algorithms?
The city would make decisions without understanding reliability. Tracking positive/negative counts at each node builds confidence models that improve with data.#What would result if a city relied on a decision tree model with insufficient confidence tracking when making critical infrastructure decisions based on sensor data?#What way would you plan to enhance decision-making accuracy in smart city systems by continuously updating confidence metrics?#How would you solve the problem of unreliable predictions in environmental monitoring by incorporating statistical confidence measures?#How would you apply confidence modeling techniques to improve the reliability of automated infrastructure maintenance scheduling?
Moore's Law only addresses hardware capacity. AGI requires understanding virtual machines and psychological processes, not just raw processing power—the prediction conflates the two.#How would you apply Moore's Law to evaluate Ray Kurzweil's prediction that AGI will be achieved by 2030 and ASI by 2045?#What would result if researchers focused solely on increasing computational power without developing theories of mind and cognition?#How would you apply what you learned about the relationship between transistor count and intelligence to critique technological singularity predictions?#How would you solve the problem of distinguishing between hardware capacity and software intelligence when planning AI research timelines?
The anatomical model wouldn't explain intelligence because neural connections don't reveal computational functions. Understanding requires top-down questions about psychological processes.#What would result if whole-brain emulation projects successfully mapped every neuron but failed to understand the virtual machines implemented in the frontal cortex?#How would you solve the intelligence problem using both neuroscientific data and computational theories of psychological processes?#What way would you plan to integrate bottom-up brain modeling with top-down cognitive architecture to achieve genuine understanding?#How would you apply the concept of virtual machines to explain why complete neural mapping is insufficient for understanding cognition?
