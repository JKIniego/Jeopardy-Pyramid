The biological paradigm views the nervous system as a massively parallel, hierarchical network of neurons.#What is a neural network?#What is a digital network?#What is a Turing Machine?#What is a feedback loop?
These are responsible for receiving incoming signals from other neurons.#What are dendrites?#What are axons?#What are synapses?#What is a mitochondria?
This is originally inspired by the information-processing mechanisms of the human brain.#What are artificial neural networks?#What are digital networks?#What are cellular automata?#What are symbolic systems?
This function in a neural network transforms the weighted sum of inputs into an output signal.#What is the activation or transfer function?#What is the recall function?#What is the bias factor?#What is the summation rule?
Neural networks process information through multiple interconnected layers known as input, hidden, and output layers.#What are neural network layers?#What are genetic layers?#What are symbolic modules?#What are computational blocks?
This model is the most widely used neural network learning algorithm.#What is the backpropagation model?#What is the Hopfield network?#What is the Kohonen network?#What is the Adaline model?
The change in a connectionâ€™s weight increases when both neurons are activated.#What is Hebbian learning?#What is competitive learning?#What is reinforcement learning?#What is the delta rule?
