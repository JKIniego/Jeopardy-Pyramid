The Study Panel's view is that the difference between an arithmetic calculator and a human brain is not one of kind, but of scale, speed, degree of autonomy, and generality, placing them on a multi-dimensional spectrum of intelligence.#What is the relationship between a calculator and a human brain within the Study Panel's intelligence framework?#What is the definition of the "AI effect"?#Can you list the key factors that place an entity on the intelligence spectrum?#Why is the human brain considered a different kind of intelligence than a calculator?
Whereas traditional machine learning focused primarily on pattern mining, reinforcement learning shifts the focus to experience-driven sequential decision-making to learn about and execute actions in the real world.#How do reinforcement learning and traditional machine learning differ in their core objectives?#What is the primary function of reinforcement learning?#Can you list the factors that have provided reinforcement learning with a "shot in the arm"?#What is an example of a recent success in reinforcement learning?
Large-scale machine learning concerns scaling existing algorithms to work with extremely large data sets, while deep learning is a class of learning procedures based on adaptive artificial neural networks that has been particularly successful in areas like computer vision.#What is the primary distinction between the focus of large-scale machine learning and that of deep learning?#How would you classify deep learning?#What is the function of large-scale machine learning?#What evidence can you list for the success of deep learning?
Research in collaborative systems investigates models for autonomous systems to work with humans and other systems, whereas crowdsourcing research investigates methods to augment computer systems by making automated calls to human expertise for problems computers cannot solve alone.#What is the fundamental difference in the roles of humans and machines between collaborative systems and crowdsourcing?#What is the best-known example of crowdsourcing?#How would you classify Amazon Mechanical Turk?#What motive is there for the growing interest in collaborative systems?
While dramatized predictive policing tools raise the specter of innocent people being unjustifiably targeted, well-deployed AI prediction tools have the potential to actually remove or reduce human bias rather than reinforcing it.#How do the potential positive and negative outcomes of predictive policing tools contrast with each other?#Can you give an example of how AI analytics are used to detect white-collar crime?#What is the function of the CompStat tool?#What motive is there for law enforcement to use crowd simulations?
In a clinical setting, AI assistance could shift the physician's role from soliciting symptoms and correlating patterns in their heads to supervising an automated process, allowing them to apply their experience and intuition to guide and evaluate the machine's output.#How does the introduction of AI systems propose to alter the cognitive components of a physician's role in diagnostics?#What is the function of a "cognitive assistant" in healthcare?#Can you list the barriers to the adoption of AI in healthcare?#Why are user interfaces for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) considered substandard?
As labor becomes a less important factor in production compared to owning intellectual capital, a majority of citizens may find their labor's value insufficient for a socially acceptable standard of living, which will require a political, rather than purely economic, response.#What is the implied causal relationship between AI's effect on production factors and the need for new social safety nets?#Can you list the policy responses that countries like Switzerland and Finland have considered?#How is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) an insufficient measure for the value of digital goods?#What is the main idea behind viewing AI as a "radically different mechanism for wealth creation"?
A study of privacy regulation found that countries with strict, detailed regulations bred a "compliance mentality," while those with more ambiguous goals combined with tough transparency and enforcement were more successful in catalyzing companies to innovate and proactively protect privacy.#What conclusion can be drawn from the multi-year study on privacy regulation that can be applied to future AI policy?#Why is it misguided to attempt to regulate "AI" in general?#Can you list the different areas of law that AI is likely to touch?#How would you classify the US approach to AI regulation to date?
The prospect of AI behaving in many ways designers do not expect challenges the prevailing assumption within tort law that courts only compensate victims for foreseeable injuries.#What are some of the problems of applying the prevailing assumption within tort law to unexpected behavior of AI?#How is tort law related to the case of AI behaving erratically?#Can you distinguish between civil liability and the unexpected behavior of AI?#What are the parts of AI that make it behave in many ways designers do not expect?
Regulatory systems that rely on strict and detailed regulations, such as those in Spain and France, bred a “compliance mentality” within corporations which discouraged both innovation and robust privacy protections unlike those, such as the United States and Germany, that emphasize transparency requirements and meaningful enforcement.#How does the impact of regulatory systems relying on strict and detailed regulations contrast with those systems emphasizing transparency requirements and meaningful enforcement?#What are some of the motives behind regulating AI within corporations?#What evidence can you list for “compliance mentality” within corporations such as those in Spain and France?#What are the parts and features of regulatory systems that breed “compliance mentality” within corporations?
