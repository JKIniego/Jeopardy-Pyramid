The module describes this field as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence.#What is Artificial Intelligence?#What is Cognitive Science?#What is Data Analytics?#What is Computational Logic?
The study known as AI100 was launched at Stanford University to provide a century-long look at the influence of AI on society.#What is the One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence?#What is the Global AI Forecast Project?#What is the Human-Centered Computing Program?#What is the Stanford Robotics Initiative?
The inaugural AI100 report focused on life in a typical North American city by 2030.#What is “AI and Life in 2030”?#What is “AI in the Global South”?#What is “AI and Military Applications”?#What is “AI and Rural Development”?
Eight domains they considered
most salient: transportation; service robots; healthcare; education; low-resource
communities; public safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment where AI has the greatest impact.#What are the eight domains of AI impact?#What are the six principles of AI ethics?#What are the five stages of AI innovation?#What are the four pillars of automation?
The 2015 AI100 Study Panel was chaired by Peter Stone of the University of Texas at Austin and included 17 experts from academia, industry, and policy.#Who led the 2015 AI100 Study Panel?#Who founded DeepMind?#Who organized the AAAI Summit?#Who headed the IBM Watson Team?
Predictive analytics and real-time monitoring are identified as tools for preventing and responding to emergencies.#What is AI in public safety and security?#What is AI in industrial automation?#What is AI in entertainment media?#What is AI in urban planning?
This describes how urban areas will benefit from AI systems that improve resource management and connectivity.#What is AI in smart city infrastructure?#What is AI in agriculture?#What is AI in defense systems?#What is AI in robotics?
The field of Artificial Intelligence encompasses research areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, reinforcement learning, and neuromorphic computing.#What are current areas of AI research?#What are the stages of software design?#What are the branches of data analytics?#What are the steps of scientific inquiry?
This describes the repeating pattern where newer technologies brought into the common fold by AI are no longer considered as “Artificial Intelligence”.#What is the odd paradox?#What is the AI winter?#What is a superhuman robot race?#What is the even paradox?
This is a set of technologies that seek to mimic biological neural networks to improve the hardware efficiency and robustness of computing systems.#What is neuromorphic computing?#What are collaborative systems?#What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?#What is deep learning?
