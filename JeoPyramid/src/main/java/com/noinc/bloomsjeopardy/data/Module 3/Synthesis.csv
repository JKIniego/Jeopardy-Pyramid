You can use Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS). It works by running DFS with a small depth limit. If no solution is found, the depth is increased, and DFS is run again. This repeats until the goal is found. It keeps DFS’s memory efficiency but guarantees BFS’s optimal solution.#How would you design a new search algorithm that mixes DFS’s low memory use with BFS’s ability to always find the best solution?#How would you design a new search algorithm that adapts its depth limits dynamically based on the complexity of the problem?#How would you design a new search algorithm that balances fast exploration with guaranteed completeness in large problem spaces?#How would you design a new search algorithm that combines iterative deepening with heuristics to improve efficiency?
You can improve Hill Climbing by adding backtracking to try earlier paths when stuck, or by making big random jumps to escape flat or tricky areas. These changes help it explore more of the problem space.#What solutions would you suggest for improving Hill Climbing so it doesn’t get stuck on local maxima, plateaus, or ridges?#What solutions would you suggest for improving Hill Climbing so it explores multiple promising paths in parallel?#What solutions would you suggest for improving Hill Climbing so it adapts its step size dynamically to the landscape of the search space?#What solutions would you suggest for improving Hill Climbing so it can combine deterministic search with probabilistic exploration?
The AI would use Minimax to choose the best moves and Alpha-Beta pruning to skip unneeded moves. A move generator suggests possible plays, a static evaluation function scores them, and Minimax with Alpha-Beta makes the final choice faster and smarter.#How would you create a game-playing AI that uses both Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning in a two-player game?#How would you create a game-playing AI that integrates heuristic evaluation with Alpha-Beta pruning for faster decision-making?#How would you create a game-playing AI that uses iterative deepening with Minimax to handle strict time limits?#How would you create a game-playing AI that applies Alpha-Beta pruning across multiple parallel processors for speed?
Use dependency-directed backtracking. Instead of undoing just the last step, the system looks back to the earlier bad choice that caused the failure. It also remembers wrong paths so it won’t repeat them. This makes backtracking more efficient.#How would you design a way for the Dictionary Viterbi Algorithm (DVA) to handle failures when selectFrom() can’t find a letter?#How would you design a backtracking strategy that blends constraint propagation to reduce unnecessary exploration?#How would you design a backtracking strategy that can learn from past problem instances to improve efficiency over time?#How would you design a backtracking strategy that integrates heuristics to prioritize the most promising choices?
Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) works best. It finds the shortest path like BFS but only stores the current path like DFS, making it memory-efficient for very large search spaces.#How would you design a search strategy that finds the best path but uses very little memory?#How would you design a search strategy that switches between DFS and BFS depending on the structure of the search tree?#How would you design a search strategy that balances path optimality with speed in massive problem spaces?#How would you design a search strategy that incorporates heuristic guidance while keeping memory use minimal?
The heuristic can count the minimum moves needed for each piece to reach its correct spot. This gives a lower bound of the solution steps. It won’t overestimate, so it works well with algorithms like A*, guiding the search toward the goal faster.#How would you design a heuristic function h(n) to make solving a Rubik’s Cube more efficient?#How would you design a heuristic function h(n) to solve sliding tile puzzles without overestimating the cost?#How would you design a heuristic function h(n) that speeds up pathfinding in grid-based maps like mazes?#How would you design a heuristic function h(n) for scheduling problems to minimize total completion time?
The algorithm would explore the search space widely using probabilities (branch and bound) while avoiding local traps with simulated annealing’s ability to accept “bad” moves temporarily. Together, they balance global search and local refinement, making it more likely to find the global best solution.#What might happen if you combined stochastic branch and bound with simulated annealing for global optimization?#What might happen if you combined genetic algorithms with simulated annealing for hybrid optimization?#What might happen if you combined tabu search with branch and bound to handle complex scheduling problems?#What might happen if you combined particle swarm optimization with simulated annealing for large-scale search?
Do a quick heuristic check of possible moves, then explore the most promising ones first.
