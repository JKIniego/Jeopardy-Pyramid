A situation qualifies as a problem when the path from the initial state to the goal is not immediately obvious, meaning the challenge lies not in the existence of a goal, but in how to achieve it.#How is a problem defined by the difficulty of identifying a clear path from the initial state to the goal?#Why is every situation automatically a problem, regardless of clarity?#What explains why the initial state is irrelevant to identifying a problem?#Why do goals always reveal themselves without effort in problem-solving?
Polya’s five-step approach emphasizes systematically solving problems, from understanding to revising algorithms, is more effective than guessing and can be applied to various disciplines such as mathematics, engineering, and business.#How does Polya’s five-step process provide a universal structure for solving diverse problems?#Why is guessing more efficient than systematic approaches to problem solving?#What is the reason that problem-solving is limited only to mathematics?#Why does problem-solving not require revision once an algorithm is created?
The divide and conquer strategy alleviates the overwhelming nature of large problems by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts to be solved step by step.#What is the main advantage of using divide and conquer in problem-solving?#Why does splitting problems always lead to incorrect results?#Why should large problems always be solved in one attempt?#Why does divide and conquer make problem-solving more difficult?
When several production rules match a situation, conflict resolution prevents the system from firing all of them at once or endlessly looping.#What problem does conflict resolution help to avoid?#Why is it better for production systems to consider new facts?#Why do production systems work best when they fire matching rules at once?#What makes conflict resolution unnecessary when rules overlap?
Reasoning in AI involves manipulating symbols that represent propositions to generate new knowledge, similar to how arithmetic transforms numbers, allowing sentences like "John loves Mary” and "Mary is coming” to conclude that "Someone John loves is coming.”#How does reasoning resemble arithmetic but operate over propositions instead of numbers?#How is reasoning related to understanding the problem?#How does reasoning replace logic with emotions in AI systems?#Why does reasoning eliminate the need for conclusions?
Declarative knowledge, which encompasses facts that enable the application of rules such as modus ponens and modus tollens, allows us to deduce that a cheetah has sharp teeth based on the facts that all carnivores have sharp teeth and a cheetah is a carnivore.#How does declarative knowledge allow new knowledge to be derived from rules of inference?#Why does declarative knowledge fail to use rules of inference?#Why does declarative only store single-use statements?#How does declarative knowledge avoid generalization of variables?
Scripts outline typical sequences of events in specific contexts, like a bank robbery, detailing entry conditions, roles, props, and outcomes, which may include obtaining a gun, holding up the bank, and making a getaway.#How do scripts represent typical event sequences?#Why do scripts avoid describing sequences of events?#Why are scripts always more general than frames?#How do scripts ignore cause-and-effect relations in events?
A good expert system not only solves problems but also manages uncertainty, explains its reasoning, and justifies its conclusions like a human expert, ensuring transparency that builds trust, unlike "black box” systems that obscure their logic.#Why is it important for an expert system to explain its reasoning behind its conclusions?#What makes an expert system useful only if it interacts with users?#How can expert systems completely avoid mistakes by hiding their reasoning?#Why do expert systems focus only on giving faster answers instead of explaining results?
A person can break down multiple goals into simpler single goals.#What does it mean when a person has a clearly defined goal?#What does it mean when a person has a clearly defined initial situation?#What does it mean when a person has some ownership?#What does it mean when a person has a clearly defined set of resources?
A certain symbol can mean something or many symbols can mean the same thing (e.g. VIII can stand for 8).#What is representation?#What is knowledge?#What is manipulation?#What is reasoning?
