According to the composite view of Gardner, Perkins, and Sternberg, intelligence is best described as this combination of abilities.#What is learning, posing problems, and solving problems?#What is memorization and quick thinking?#What is solving analytical and mathematical problems?#What is genetic ability and IQ score?
Some aspects of our intellectual abilities depend heavily on our experiential histories, and some aspects depend on our genetic makeup.#Why are nature and nurture important in human cognitive development?#What is the importance of an educational background?#What is the dominance of genetic factors?#Why are environmental factors superior?
Intelligence should be understood as being dependent on an individual’s sensory capabilities and environmental context rather than using human abilities as the universal standard, since different beings succeed throughout different sensory and motor abilities suited to their specific environments.#How can intelligence be defined relative to an organism’s environment and sensory abilities?#Why should intelligence only be measured through language and abstract thought?#Why must human reasoning and problem-solving be the sole measure of intelligence?#How is human intelligence treated as the universal benchmark for all species?
The "alien view perspective” explains that an alien observer might identify entirely different Earth entities as intelligent based on their own sensory and cultural framework.#What is the understanding that humans have a human-centric bias in defining intelligence?#What is the proof that aliens would automatically recognize humans as the most intelligent Earth species?#What is the evidence that physical appearance determines intelligence recognition?#What is the evidence that intelligence definitions are universally consistent across all observers?
Bees communicate with each other by means of a dance routine, spiders have their own strategy in catching prey, and octopuses have learning abilities.#What are the possibilities of intelligence in animals?#In what ways do animals adapt to their environment?#How do animals have different traits from each other?#How does the environment influence the intelligence of animals?
Despite their simplicity, AI applications in game playing serve as structured environments with clear rules and measurable outcomes while simulating real-life decision-making situations.#How do games serve as an important testing ground for artificial intelligence research?#Why do games require no intelligence or strategic thinking?#What is the evidence that games are too simple to teach us AI capabilities?#Why do video games face no computational challenges?
The effectiveness of an AI system depends not only on how much knowledge it has, but also how it uses its components, such as the learning element that improves performance, the performance element that chooses actions, the critic provides feedback, and the problem generator, which suggests new actions for learning.#How do the four components of a learning agent interact to help an AI system improve its performance?#How can hardware alone ensure that an AI system continues to learn and adapt?#How would an AI improve without feedback or exploration?#How can an AI rely only on choosing actions without learning or feedback?
Wireless technology transformed AI by allowing computers to connect and share memory, specialization, and information rapidly across networks, leading to the idea of distributed intelligence rather than treating each computer separately.#How did wireless connectivity shift AI from isolated machines to a form of distributed intelligence?#Why is human intelligence considered superior because it avoids distribution across networks?#How did wireless technology prevent computers from exchanging information with one another?#Why can AI today succeed without relying on networks or shared memory?
This early chatbot demonstrated simple pattern-matching and rephrasing, which created the illusion of human conversation.#How did ELIZA occasionally fool users into thinking they were talking to a human?#What was the role of ELIZA in natural language processing?#What complex mathematical problems did ELIZA solve?#How did ELIZA solve complex mathematical problems?
Many researchers followed McCarthy’s lead in AI and continued to develop AI systems which saw the period in development of expert systems.#What is one of the causes of the revival in AI?#How did robotics influence AI?#What helped in the development of AI?#How were expert systems developed?
