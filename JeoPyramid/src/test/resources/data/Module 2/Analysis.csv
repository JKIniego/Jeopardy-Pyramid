A situation is considered a problem only when the path to the goal is not immediately obvious, making the same scenario a mere routine for one person but a complex challenge for another.#What distinguishes a "problem” from a "routine exercise” based on an individual’s perspective?#What are the key components in the graphical representation of problem-solving?#In what ways does higher-order thinking apply to problem-solving?#Which four conditions must be satisfied for a problem to be well-defined?
One type of knowledge is compiled as a sequence of steps for a task and is often structured as IF-THEN rules, while the other is passive facts about the world, offering greater flexibility for unforeseen applications.#How do procedural and declarative knowledge differ in terms of their structure and adaptability?#How is declarative knowledge used by a reasoning system?#What are the main advantages of procedural knowledge?#What is the definition of meta-knowledge?
This problem-solving technique overcomes the limitation of a monolithic state-space search by decomposing#How does the problem reduction approach differ from state space representation in managing complexity?#What are the primary deficiencies of the state space representation method?#What is the function of AND-OR graph in problem reduction?#What is the definition of a forward state space search
Unlike terms for physical augmentation like "artificial muscle,” this term chosen by John McCarthy in 1956 is described as "emotion-laden,” potentially hindering the field’s perception by suggesting the creation of human replacements.#What is the inferred negative consequence of John McCarthy’s choice of the term "artificial intelligence”?#How does a problem-solving team improve its overall capabilities?#How are tools used to extend physical and mental capabilities?#What is the relationship between AI and machine intelligence?
In problem-solving, one approach guarantees a correct solution through an exhaustive, computationally intensive search, while the other uses "rules of thumb” to find a likely solution more efficiently but without a guarantee of success.#How do algorithms and heuristics compare in terms of their process, efficiency, and certainty of their outcomes?#What is the problem-solving technique of deduction?#How does solving a simpler version of a problem help?#What role does planning play in managing complexity?
The text argues that unintelligent behavior is often not a lack of knowledge but a "failure to use what he or she did know,” linking intelligence to the act of "thinking” which brings relevant knowledge to bear on a situation.#What is the relationship between "knowledge,” intelligent behavior,” and the process of "thinking”?#How is "thinking” studied as a computational process?#What makes intelligence a complex and mysterious phenomenon?#What is the definition of knowledge representation and reasoning?
A concept defined by the boundaries of human memory and computational capabilities, which requires problem solutions to be correct, executable, comprehensible, and of a manageable grain size#What are the distinct, interacting constraints that define the boundaries#Why must a solution be 100% correct to fit within this concept?#How is the executability of a solution measured?#What is the difference between intensional and extensional knowledge representation?
One concept is a propositional attitude where the proposition is held to be true and accurate, while a related concept is used when the holder’s judgement about the word is not claimed to be necessarily accurate or held for appropriate reasons?#What distinguishes "knowledge” from "belief” in terms of the proposition’s assumed validity?#What is the nature of a proposition?#How are verbs like "hopes,” and "doubts” classified?#What is the basic idea shared between knowledge and belief?
An expert system explains its reasoning to a certain problem, but it takes too long to respond.#How does solving a problem conflict with time performance?#Why is responding to a certain amount of time more important than solving a problem?#How does heuristic reasoning relate with empirical rules?#Why does solving a problem in a reasonable amount of time go hand in hand with reliability?
A student uses a step-by-step algorithm in coming up with an answer that is based on facts and rules.#How does procedural and declarative knowledge relate?#Why is domain specific knowledge more important than commonsense knowledge?#Why is procedural knowledge more important than declarative knowledge?#How does domain specific knowledge go hand in hand with commonsense knowledge?
